# final-year-project-operating-computer-cursor-using-eye-and-face-movements
This project focuses on developing a methodology to facilitate computer cursor control using eye and face movements for people with physical disabilities such as Quadriplegics and amputees. The proposed system requires very basic requirements like webcam and a few Python libraries such as OpenCV, Numpy, imutils, dlib and PyAutoGUI.
